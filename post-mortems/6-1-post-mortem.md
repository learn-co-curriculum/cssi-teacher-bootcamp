# 6/1 Bootcamp Post-Mortem

+ ENcourage promptness, especially on day 1

+ Try to integrate 'rapid fire teaching' earlier, maybe do twice. Teachers really enjoyed this and felt like they got a lot out of it.

+ Most of our lectures started and were framed as discussions/brainstorms. Was very effective to pull out answers from the teachers instead of being prescriptive.

+ Elana should spend as much time as possible with us on day 1 and take over the ops messaging.

+ Minimize "informational" sessions (campsite, SPAs, etc)

+ Find a way to differentiate between the Google/SE/FE content. The Google crew was strong and was able to be more self guided, but having some structure in place for them will be important.

+ Show videos from scholarship students - very motivating.

+ More Sinatra practice necessary

+ Prework is super important. We need to push them through as best as possible.

+ Improv was great, try to integrate as much as possible, especially when teachers have been working for a long time without a break.
