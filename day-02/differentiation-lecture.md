# Differentiation

Discussion based lecture - How do we manage learners of different speeds?

Start with framing that there will always be students of different learning speeds and coding abilities in the class. You'll most likely have a student or two who can code circles around you and a few students that really struggle with the content. How do you ensure that they are challenged appropriately?

+ Break up into groups and give them 10 minutes to brainstorm and then have a spokesperson share for each group.

+ Mention:
  + Student that are lost, with you, and bored   
  + Advanced/Stretch labs and extensions of normal labs.
  + Encouraging faster students to teach and coach slower ones. ("Teaching is Learning")
