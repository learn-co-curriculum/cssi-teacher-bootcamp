# Writing Test Driven Labs

+ Arrange - Act - Assert
+ Get discussion going about what you want to test (conceptually)
  + Ability to create a class
  + Class should have initialization argument
  + Class should have certain attributes
  + Class should be able to manipulate data in some way...
+ We want to test X - what tests would you write to do this?
+ Passing cases and failing cases
+ RSPEC syntax (describe, let, before, expect, it, let)
+ File structure (Gemfile, spec directory)
+ http://betterspecs.org/
+ Look at labs
+ stdin and stdout (look at playlister) for puts
+ Break into groups
