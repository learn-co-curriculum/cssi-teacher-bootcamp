# Group Projects and Ideation Discussion and Modeling

+ What does effective group work look like and how do we facilitate it?

+ Ideation
  + Set up purpose of the project (Building is the best way to learn)- Tinkering
  + Discuss the audience
  + "Tinkering is what happens when you try something you don’t quite know how to do, guided by whim, imagination, and curiosity. When you tinker, there are no instructions - but there also no failures, no right or wrong ways of doing things. It’s about figuring out how things work and reworking them. Contraptions, machines, wildly mismatched objects working in harmony - this is the stuff of tinkering. Tinkering is, at its most basic, a process that marries play and inquiry."
  + Show previous examples (input/output projects)
  + Encourage quantity over quality of ideas early on
  + Set clear contraints (time, resources)
  + Set a short period (5 minutes) for participants to come up with as many ideas as they possibly can. There are no bad ideas.
  + Come up with intended solution to problem
  + Sketch out next steps. Break down the problem into clear tasks
  + Teachers give feedback on difficulty (no comment on whether they like the idea or not)

+ Group Work
  + Set expectations early on
  + Run "Stand Ups" with students
  + Students should have specific roles within the group
  + Give students time to 'pitch'.
  + Pros and cons of group assignment vs free flowing group selections
