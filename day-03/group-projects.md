# Group Projects and Ideation Discussion and Modeling

+ What does effective group work look like and how do we facilitate it?

+ Ideation
  + Show previous examples (input/output projects)
  + Encourage quantity over quality of ideas early on
  + Set clear contraints (time, resources)
  + Discuss the audience
  + Come up with intended solution to problem
  + Sketch out next steps. Break down the problem into clear tasks
  + Teachers give feedback on difficulty (no comment on whether they like the idea or not)

+ Group Work
  + Set expectations early on
  + Run "Stand Ups" with students
  + Students should have specific roles within the group
  + Give students time to 'pitch'.
  + Pros and cons of group assignment vs free flowing group selections
