+ Imbue teachers with a sense of ownership over curriculum, make them feel empowered to be themselves in the classroom, to launch and iterate and improve.
+ Ensure teachers are technically equipped to teach FE1 and SE1 on the first day of class (and are on the way to being able to teach SE2/FE2)
+ Develop a sense of cohesion and community among the teachers - Develop lifelong friends
+ Instill Flatiron’s values and the Flatiron Pre-college ‘way’ (prioritize fun)
